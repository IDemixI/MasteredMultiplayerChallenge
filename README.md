# MasteredMultiplayerChallenge

As part of the Mastered Bootcamp that I am doing, I was tasked for my second Live Creator Challenge to create a simple Multiplayer game. Using the official Quick Starter documentation as a base, I was able to come up with a fun little 4 player "Battle Royale" that I'm calling Extreme Volleyball. I feel like this is a really solid base and that I could make a fun little game out of this at some point. This has been my first real project primarily focused on C++ so I feel like I did pretty well!
